	*Updated for Ruby 1.9.x
	
2007-01-21  George Ogata  <george.ogata@gmail.com>

	* test/test_render.rb: Born.  (Tests for #to_s, which will be
	shortly renamed #render.)

	* lib/cast/to_s.rb: Fixes for bugs found while testing:
	(Node#hang): Don't hang labelled blocks.
	(FunctionDef#to_s): Don't print types in parameter list of
	no_prototype? is true.
	({PlainLabel,Default,Case}#to_s): Print ':' with label name.
	({Address,Positive,Negative}#to_s): Separate operators for nested
	unary expressions (e.g., "& &a" instead of "&&a", since "&&" is a
	different operator.
	(Sizeof#to_s): Always print parentheses with sizeof.  (C99 doesn't
	mandate them, but seems to be a stylistic preference.)
	(Char#to_s): Distinguish between 'signed', 'unsigned', and
	unqualified chars.  (C99 does distinguish between them.)
	({Bool,Complex,Imaginary}#to_s): Print longness correctly.
	(Conditional#to_s): Handle nested Conditionals correctly.
	(MemberInit#to_s): Print member correctly.

	* lib/cast/parse.rb (Member.parse): Fix Member.parse.
	(Expression.parse): Support CompoundLiterals without types (as
	allowed in declarators only).

2007-01-20  George Ogata  <george.ogata@gmail.com>

	* lib/cast/parse.rb (Declarator.parse): Allow specification
	of #num_bits.

2006-05-07  George Ogata  <george.ogata@gmail.com>

	* lib/cast/preprocessor.rb: Added C::Preprocessor, a preprocessor
	  that wraps around the command in Config::CONFIG['CPP'].  Assumes
	  POSIX-style -D and -I options.

2006-05-06  George Ogata  <george.ogata@gmail.com>

	* lib/cast/c_nodes.rb: Added fields:
		+ CharLiteral#prefix
		+ StringLiteral#prefix

	  For StringLiteral and CharLiteral, added optional parameter for
	  #prefix to #initialize.  Also, #wide? and #wide= are now methods
	  rather than fields.

	  For IntLiteral and FloatLiteral, #format now comes first in the
	  list of fields.

	* ext/yylex.re (yylex): Restrict IntLiteral suffixes to those in
	  C99, so cases like 2e-2 are now parsed correctly.  Also, allow
	  newlines in StringLiterals and CharLiterals.

	* lib/cast/c.y (on_error): Made parse error message more meaningful.

2006-04-26  George Ogata  <george.ogata@gmail.com>

	* Release 0.1.0.

	* Rejigged gemspec to compile new lexer on installation.

	* Moved lib files under lib/cast so they don't all end up directly
	  in the load path.

	* Merged install.rb into Rakefile.

2005-07-17  George Ogata  <george.ogata@gmail.com>

	* src/parser.c: Born.

	* src/cast_core.c: Born.

	* pre/yylex.re: Born.

	* include/cast.h: Born.

	* lib/c.y (next_token): Wrote the lexer in C.

	* test/*: merged common.rb into run.rb.

2005-07-10  George Ogata  <george.ogata@gmail.com>

	* lib/c_nodes.rb: Added fields:
		+ StringLiteral#wide?
		+ CharLiteral#wide?
		+ IntLiteral#suffix
		+ FloatLiteral#format
		+ FloatLiteral#suffix

2005-03-14  George Ogata  <george.ogata@gmail.com>

	* lib/c.y: Allow type names in Call#args.  (Not C99, but useful
	  for macros.)

2005-03-07  George Ogata  <george.ogata@gmail.com>

	* lib/to_s.rb (CompoundLiteral#to_s): Made it work.

2005-02-26  George Ogata  <george.ogata@gmail.com>

	* lib/to_s.rb (AssignmentExpression#to_s): Fixed for when #lval
	  is a Comma.

2005-02-23  George Ogata  <george.ogata@gmail.com>

	* lib/inspect.rb: Renamed Node#to_debug to Node#inspect.
	  Renamed to_debug.rb to inspect.rb.

	* lib/to_s.rb (Parameter#to_s): Fixed for when #type is nil.

2005-02-19  George Ogata  <george.ogata@gmail.com>

	* Hello, world!
